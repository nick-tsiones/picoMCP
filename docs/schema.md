# Schema

qd stores local cache state in `.qd/qd.db`. Do not commit the binary DB.

The portable, committed source of truth is the qd JSON export:

```sh
qd export --out roadmap/spec-dag.json
```

That export has `schema_version`, `exported_at`, `registries`, `nodes`, `edges`, `findings`, `runs`, `node_notes`, `assignments`, `waves`, and `wave_memberships`. A fresh clone can rebuild its local DB cache with:

```sh
qd setup --no-hooks
qd import --from roadmap/spec-dag.json
qd sync --from roadmap/spec-dag.json
```

## Nodes

Nodes are executable specs. They include title, kind, typed milestone, group, projects, status, priority, estimate, risk, branch, spec, acceptance, validation text, typed verification entries, audit focus guidance, context, status reason, manual/external/policy blocker metadata, per-node check/CI overrides, and timestamps.

If groups, projects, or milestones have been registered, qd validates node values against those registries. This lets a project define strict scheduling lanes, product areas, and milestone ranks without hard-coding one universal taxonomy.

Minimal one-node JSON for `qd node add --from-json <file>`:

```json
{
  "id": "docs-audit",
  "title": "Audit documentation setup path",
  "kind": "docs",
  "status": "ready",
  "priority": "P2",
  "risk": "low",
  "estimatePoints": 1,
  "spec": "Review setup docs for a first-time adopter.",
  "acceptance": "The docs explain install, setup, checks, CI, and first node orchestration.",
  "verification": [{ "type": "manual", "value": "Read README and docs/setup.md end to end." }],
  "auditFocus": [
    "Look for language-specific assumptions.",
    "Check qd merge semantics are explicit."
  ]
}
```

Bulk mint plan for `qd nodes add-bulk --from-json <file>`:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "core-setup",
      "title": "Initialize qd setup",
      "spec": "Configure qd for this repository.",
      "acceptance": "qd doctor passes after check and CI commands are configured."
    },
    {
      "id": "first-feature",
      "title": "Implement first feature",
      "spec": "Deliver the first scoped feature.",
      "acceptance": "The feature passes the configured CI gate."
    }
  ],
  "edges": [{ "from": "core-setup", "to": "first-feature", "type": "requires" }]
}
```

Bulk minting is transactional. qd validates the full plan, auto-registers referenced groups, projects, and milestones, and writes the nodes and edges as one batch.

Manual or external blockers are represented on the node:

```json
{
  "id": "fixture-review",
  "title": "Review fixture provenance",
  "status": "blocked",
  "blockedBy": "manual",
  "blockedReason": "Fixture provenance review has not been signed off.",
  "blockedOwner": "trevor",
  "spec": "Wait for the review outcome before dispatching implementation.",
  "acceptance": "The provenance review is signed off and recorded."
}
```

Blocked nodes are excluded from `qd ready`. Use dependency edges for technical ordering, findings for audit issues, and blocker metadata for manual, external, or policy state.

## Edges

Edges connect nodes. Only `requires` edges participate in readiness.

## Runs

Runs record implementation, audit, resolve, check, verification, CI, and merge lifecycle events.

`qd check run <node>` runs the configured `check_command` or the node's `check_command` override, writes a log under `.qd/logs/`, and records a check run. A passed check does not make the node mergeable.

`qd ci run <node>` runs the configured `ci_command` or the node's `ci_command` override, writes a log under `.qd/logs/`, records a pass/fail run, and updates the node to `mergeable` or `blocked`.

`qd ci poll <node>` uses a configured provider adapter to wait for hosted CI and record the same pass/fail result. The first adapter is GitHub through `gh`; unsupported providers should be added as adapters rather than encoded into node schema.

`qd merge <node>` records qd state only. It does not run `git merge`, open a pull request, squash commits, or push anything. Repositories should perform the actual git/GitHub merge through their normal workflow and use `qd merge` to record that the node satisfied qd's gate. Use `--use-existing-commit <sha>` when qd should record the commit produced by an external merge.

## Assignments

Assignments record opaque external ownership. qd does not parse agent identities and does not launch workers. Use assignments to record who owns implementation, audit, repair, review, planning, or exploration work, plus branch/worktree/scope, produced commits, evidence, and completion summary.

```json
{
  "nodeId": "first-feature",
  "role": "worker",
  "owner": "external:worker-1",
  "branch": "worker/first-feature",
  "worktreePath": "/scratch/worktrees/repo-worker-first-feature",
  "scope": "owned files or module"
}
```

Open assignments cannot reuse the same branch or worktree path. Complete, fail, or cancel stale assignments before reusing those resources.

## Waves

Waves group nodes and assignments into orchestration batches. qd records wave state; it does not dispatch agents.

```json
{
  "kind": "implementation",
  "summary": "alpha cleanup wave",
  "nodes": ["first-feature"],
  "assignments": ["assignment-id"]
}
```

Use waves to make broad/deep audit cadence auditable through qd state instead of chat memory.

## Findings

Findings belong to a node and can be P0, P1, P2, or P3.

- P0/P1 block the gate.
- P2/P3 can be promoted into future nodes after the gate passes.

Structured audit reports can be imported with `qd finding add --from-report <file>`. The report must contain `nodeId` or `node_id` unless the node id is passed positionally, plus a `findings` array with severity, title, evidence, and optional path, line, expected, and suggested fix fields. `qd audit pass <node> --from-report <file>` uses the same shape, allows an empty findings array for clean audits, fails on P0/P1 findings, and promotes P2/P3 findings.

Minimal audit report:

```json
{
  "nodeId": "first-feature",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "P1",
      "title": "Acceptance criterion is not implemented",
      "evidence": "The required behavior is absent from the tested workflow.",
      "expected": "The acceptance criterion passes under the configured check command.",
      "suggestedFix": "Implement the missing behavior and rerun qd gate."
    },
    {
      "severity": "P2",
      "title": "Add a regression test",
      "evidence": "The behavior works manually but lacks automated coverage.",
      "suggested_fix": "Promote this into a follow-up test node."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Priority

- `P0`: critical issue such as security, data loss, build break, or severe wrong behavior.
