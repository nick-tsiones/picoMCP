# Quick DAG Orchestrator Bootstrap

Quick DAG (`qdcli`, executable `qd`) is a CLI for orchestrator-led agentic software work. It does not run agents and it is not tied to any language, framework, package manager, CI vendor, or hosting model. It gives one central orchestrator agent a durable DAG ledger for specs, dependency edges, claims, audits, findings, check/CI state, merge state, velocity, critical path, and ETA.

The intended model:

- One orchestrator agent manages the DAG and keeps its own context clean.
- The orchestrator selects ready nodes and delegates implementation/audit to subagents.
- Subagents may work in git worktrees, remote machines, or any project-specific setup.
- qd does not manage or police the execution environment.
- qd enforces the work contract: dependencies are respected, specs are completed, audits happen, P0/P1 findings are resolved, P2/P3 findings enter the DAG, and CI passes before merge.
- Main should stay green. If CI does not pass, the node does not merge.

## Install

From the project that wants to use Quick DAG, make sure the `qd` executable is available. The source repository is:

```text
https://github.com/cat-cave/qdcli
```

If `qd` is not available, follow the install instructions in that repository, then verify:

```sh
qd --version
```

## Setup In The Target Repo

Run from the repository that will use qd:

```sh
qd setup
qd agent install skills-sh
```

qd stores its working cache in `.qd/qd.db`, but that binary DB is local state. The portable source of truth is a committed JSON export:

```sh
qd export --out roadmap/spec-dag.json
qd import --from roadmap/spec-dag.json
qd sync --from roadmap/spec-dag.json
```

Use this export/import path when moving between machines, worktrees, or remote execution hosts. Do not ask the user to commit `.qd/qd.db`. After qd mutations that should be shared, export and commit the JSON snapshot:

```sh
qd export --deterministic --out roadmap/spec-dag.json
git add roadmap/spec-dag.json
git commit -m "Update qd DAG"
```

Before creating work, configure the repository's real commands:

```sh
qd config set check-command --value "<fast local check command>"
qd config set ci-command --value "<full green command>"
qd config set merge-strategy --value "squash"
qd config get ci-command
```

Pick commands by meaning, not by tool name:

- `check_command` is a fast preflight used by `qd check run <node>`. It should catch obvious breakage before an auditor or resolver spends more time on the node. A passed check is useful evidence, but it does not make a node mergeable.
- `ci_command` is the full trusted gate used by `qd ci run <node>`. It should be the command the project relies on before merge. A passed CI run moves the node to `mergeable`; qd merge requires that latest pass by default.

The two commands may be the same for small projects. They should be different when the project has a cheap preflight and a slower complete gate.

## Validate Setup

Run:

```sh
qd doctor --json
qd doctor --strict --json
qd status --json
qd ready --json
qd snapshot --json
```

If `qd doctor` reports config or graph errors, fix those before delegating work. Use normal `qd doctor` for advisory setup checks during migration. Use `qd doctor --strict` in dogfood repositories that want warnings such as unregistered metadata or incomplete blocker records to fail.

You may run qd from a subdirectory. qd resolves `--root`, then `QD_ROOT`, then the nearest ancestor `.qd/` directory.

For a multi-repo view, use workspace commands only for read-only planning:

```sh
qd workspace status --json
qd workspace ready --json
qd workspace graph --json
```

Workspace roll-up is not a distributed executor. It helps the orchestrator decide where attention is needed, then the orchestrator should enter the target repo and use normal qd commands there.

## Build The DAG

Create nodes as executable specs, not vague todos. Each node should be independently mergeable and include concrete acceptance criteria.

Useful commands:

```sh
qd node add --id <id> --title "<title>" --spec "<spec>" --acceptance "<acceptance>"
qd edge add <dependency-node> <blocked-node>
qd validate
qd graph --format mermaid
```

For existing projects, import the roadmap instead of manually adding hundreds of nodes:

```sh
qd import --from roadmap/spec-dag.json --schema-mapping roadmap/qd-import-map.json --dry-run --json
qd import --from roadmap/spec-dag.json --schema-mapping roadmap/qd-import-map.json
qd validate
```

Read `docs/import.md` in the qdcli repository before migrating an existing DAG. Treat import errors as graph problems to fix before orchestration. Review dry-run defaults, warnings, and dropped fields; do not assume a field was intentionally ignored unless the mapping makes that explicit. Import and bulk minting are transactional; if qd rejects the plan, fix the plan and retry rather than cleaning up partial state.

Use registered metadata when the project has real scheduling lanes, product areas, or strict milestone ordering:

```sh
qd group register --name "runtime"
qd project register --name "web"
qd milestone register --name "baseline" --rank 10
qd node add --id <id> --title "<title>" --spec "<spec>" --acceptance "<acceptance>" \
  --group "runtime" \
  --project "web" \
  --milestone "baseline" \
  --verify type=command,value="<node-specific verification command>" \
  --audit-focus "Check the risky path and failure states."
```

Rules:

- Split by mergeable behavioral increments, not files or layers.
- Use `requires` edges only for true technical prerequisites.
- Use milestones for product phases, not dependency truth.
- Add discovery nodes when unknowns must be resolved before implementation.

## Orchestrate Work

The orchestrator loop:

```sh
qd ready --json
qd snapshot --json
qd claim <node> --agent <subagent-name>
qd prompt implement <node> --json
```

Delegate the implementation prompt and project context to a subagent. When the subagent completes work, record it:

```sh
qd complete <node> --summary "<what changed>"
```

When delegation needs durable ownership records, use assignments. Assignment owners are opaque strings; examples may be `human:trevor`, `external:worker-1`, `github-actions:<run-id>`, or any other harness-owned identifier. qd records ownership and evidence, but it does not launch or control that worker.

```sh
qd assignment add <node> --role worker --owner external:worker-1 --branch worker/<node> --worktree /scratch/worktrees/<repo>-worker-<node>
qd assignment complete <assignment-id> --summary "<what changed>" --commit <sha> --evidence <path-or-url>
qd assignment list --status open --json
```

Use waves when the orchestrator is dispatching batches and needs an audit cadence that survives chat context:

```sh
qd wave start --kind implementation --summary "<wave goal>"
qd wave add-node <wave-id> <node>
qd wave add-assignment <wave-id> <assignment-id>
qd wave complete <wave-id> --summary "<what landed>"
qd wave status --json
```

If a node is blocked by a manual, external, or policy condition, record that explicitly instead of leaving it in the ready queue:

```sh
qd node edit <node> --blocked-by manual --blocked-reason "<specific blocker>" --blocked-owner "<owner>"
qd node edit <node> --clear-blocker --status ready
```

Blocked nodes are not ready work, even when dependencies are complete. Do not use blocker metadata for dependency truth; use `requires` edges for that.

Start audit:

```sh
qd audit start <node>
```

Record findings as structured state:

```sh
qd finding add <node> --severity P1 --title "<issue>" --evidence "<evidence>"
qd finding add <node> --from-report roadmap/audit-report.json
qd finding resolve <finding-id>
```

Use `qd finding list --open --severity P0,P1 --json` for a dashboard of active blockers across the DAG. Use `qd node show <node> --full --json` when a delegate or auditor needs the node plus findings, notes, and runs in one payload.

Severity policy:

- P0: security, data loss, build break, or critical incorrect behavior.
- P1: important regression or missing required acceptance.
- P2: non-blocking follow-up that should become a DAG node.
- P3: polish or future improvement.

P0/P1 findings block CI and merge. P2/P3 findings should be promoted into future nodes after the current node passes the gate:

```sh
qd gate <node>
qd promote-findings <node>
```

`qd promote-findings` returns the finding id and new node id for every promoted P2/P3, and the new node records where it came from. Use `qd finding promote <finding>` for a single finding, or `qd finding dispose <finding> --disposition accepted-risk --rationale "<why>"` when the project intentionally accepts the risk. Preserve that trail when explaining why follow-up nodes exist.

Before advancing to CI or merge, ask qd for the policy view instead of guessing:

```sh
qd policy evaluate <node> --phase ci --json
qd policy evaluate <node> --phase merge --json
```

Treat policy violations as the next piece of work, not optional advice. The default policy encodes qd's intended workflow: a passed audit before CI, declared verification evidence before CI, P2/P3 disposition before merge, and a real merge commit recorded after the repository merge. If a project intentionally relaxes a policy, record why in project setup notes so future orchestrators do not infer the wrong standard.

If the project uses worktrees, use qd's helper to make the branch/path/env convention repeatable:

```sh
qd worktree create <node> --branch spec/<node>
qd worktree env <node> --env-template .env.example --env QD_CACHE=/tmp/qd-cache
qd worktree status <node> --base main --json
```

Do not put secrets in qd notes, node specs, findings, or exports. Worktree env injection writes files in the worktree and reports the file path; qd does not store env values in the DAG. Re-running `qd worktree env` replaces qd's marked context block instead of appending duplicate variables.

## Run Checks And Merge

Normal path:

```sh
qd gate <node>
qd check run <node>
qd ci run <node>
qd merge <node>
```

For a clean happy path, `qd advance <node> --summary "<what changed>"` can run completion, gate, configured check, and configured CI in sequence. Add `--merge` only when it is correct to record qd's merge state. qd still does not perform the real git or GitHub merge.

`qd ci run` runs the configured `ci_command`, streams output, writes a log under `.qd/logs/`, records pass/fail, and moves the node to `mergeable` or `blocked`.

`qd check run` runs the configured `check_command` or the node's `check_command` override. `qd ci run` uses the node's `ci_command` override when present, otherwise the configured `ci_command`. Checks record a run and log, but only CI marks a node mergeable.

Do not record an external CI pass unless the full trusted gate already completed outside qd. Use `qd ci record-pass <node> --summary "..." --url <ci-url>` or another evidence flag.

When a supported provider adapter is configured, use qd to wait for external CI instead of hand-written polling:

```sh
qd config set ci-provider github --repo owner/name --workflow ci.yml --auth gh-cli
qd ci poll <node> --sha <commit>
```

The GitHub adapter shells out to `gh`. Other providers should be added as adapters, not as assumptions baked into the DAG model. If no adapter exists, use explicit evidence with `qd ci record-pass` or run the trusted command through `qd ci run`.

For manual verification gates declared on a node, record the signoff:

```sh
qd verification sign-off <node> --type manual --note "<what was checked>" --evidence <path-or-url>
```

For clean structured audits, prefer the composite:

```sh
qd audit pass <node> --from-report <audit-report.json>
```

It imports findings, fails on open P0/P1 findings, and promotes P2/P3 findings when the current node is clean.

`qd merge` records the merge only after qd confirms:

- no open P0/P1 findings
- node is `mergeable`
- latest CI run passed, when `require_ci_before_merge = true`

`qd merge` does not perform a git merge, squash, rebase, push, or GitHub PR operation. The orchestrator should use the repo's normal merge workflow for git state, and use `qd merge` to record that the node cleared qd's gate. In direct-to-main workflows, run `qd merge <node> --use-existing-commit <sha>` after the real merge so qd can record the commit it represents. Keep main green; do not use qd to excuse a known-bad merge.

## Inspect Progress

Use:

```sh
qd snapshot --json
qd stats --json
qd velocity --window 7
qd critical-path
qd eta
qd milestone status --milestone "<name>"
qd export --status ready,claimed,review --milestone "<name>" --json
qd view
```

These show ready work, completed points, remaining points, velocity, critical path, and ETA.

`qd view` serves the embedded read-only dashboard from the installed CLI. Use it for human inspection, but keep all state changes in CLI commands so the DAG remains auditable.

When audit context depends on branch diffs, prefer `qd diff <node> --self-only --base main` over ad hoc `main..branch` prompts. It uses the node's recorded branch and merge-base to avoid including unrelated movement from main. For uncommitted worktree changes, use `qd diff <node> --working`.

If the project has installed semantic diff tooling, use it explicitly in the audit handoff:

```sh
qd diff <node> --self-only --base main --tool sem --format markdown
qd prompt audit <node> --diff-tool sem
```

`sem` is a good fit for entity-level changed-function context. `inspect` can be useful for review triage when installed and configured, especially on large changes. Treat both as optional adapters. qd should fail loudly if a requested adapter is missing; do not silently replace semantic audit context with a plain diff and pretend the requested review happened.

## First Trial Goal

For a first adoption trial, get one real but low-risk node from ready to done:

1. create or select a ready node
2. claim it for a subagent
3. complete implementation
4. audit it
5. resolve P0/P1 findings
6. promote P2/P3 findings
7. run `qd ci run`
8. merge only after qd marks it mergeable

If the graph is wrong, fix the graph. Do not bypass the ready queue.
